I've never been on this subreddit before, so I'm not sure if I'm breaking any rules but I thought I'd put the question out there because it's been bugging me all night. It's a two part scenario I'm calling "The Greedy Waitress and the Honest Waitress". Lets suppose there's a typical restaurant. The wait staff in this establishment are considered tipped employees and are paid below minimum wage by management with the understanding that they are a "tippable" profession. In this particular. I've been reading every book about bartending and liquor since I started this project in February of this year and I've been furiously making cocktails every night at home since then as well. I do have consultants who will do thorough training for my two bartenders and for me, so we'll be ready overall. I'm paying my bartenders /hour (small town in NC, USA) and I'm paying myself nothing. Y'all. I'm shitting myself. We're about to open in three weeks and I'm worried I missed somethi. She is also including the bar porters (they do not work behind the bar or receive cash tips from customers) and the janitors in the final tip out. Her breakdown, I am told, is as follows: 80% to bartenders 10% to the barback (5% to each if both are working) 10% to the bar porters and janitors So she does not touch the 80% of cash, only the 20%. It is then counted in private the next day, sorted out among the barback(s), bar porters, and janitors in envelopes that we pick up the next shift. 
A man walks into a bar, notices a very large jar on the counter and sees that it's filled to the brim with £10 notes. He guesses there must be at least ten thousand pounds in it. He approaches the bartender and asks: "What's with the money in the jar?" "Well., you pay £10 and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Lexus." The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, "What are the three tests?" "You gotta pay first," says the barte. Just heard a beer rep tip a bartender 10 on 98. Seriously. He approaches the bartender and asks, "What's with the money in the jar?" "Well., you pay , and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Ferrari." The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, "What are the three tests?" "You gotta pay first," says the bartender, "those are the rules." So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender  which he stuffs into the jar. "Okay," says the bartender, "here's I had no idea they were paying me that much hourly. The restaurant I work at pays bartenders /hour and that’s what I was hired to do. 2 months into the job I switched to server which pays .15/hour but I guess someone in payroll screwed up because the pay stayed the same even though I have been clocking in as a server for the past 7 months. I didn’t notice due to the fact that much of the money is taken out for taxes and the rest is combined with my tips and directly deposited. I also don’. There was this man who walked into a bar and says to the bartender 10 shots of whiskey. The bartender asks, "What's the matter?" The man says, "I found out my brother is gay and marrying my best friend." The next day the same man comes in and orders 12 shots of whiskey. The bartenders asks, "What's wrong this time?" The man says, "I found out that my son is gay." The next day the same man comes in the bar and orders 15 shots of whiskey. Then the bartender asks, "Doesn't anyone Just need to vent. And I already know the answer is "find a new job." But here goes. I started in this new place, just opened 2 months ago. Rampant disorganization, but that's another story for another day. So we are supposed to tip out the bartender 10% of alcohol sales when they don't have a section, and are not in seating rotation. Also, we are supposed to tip out the bartender 10% of alcohol sales when they ARE in rotation and taking tables. Also, we only have a busser on weekends 'Tis the season.I went to a wedding yesterday - and while I was not worried about drinking, I still utilized a trick, and taught it to a couple of others at my table. Turn the wine glass - or the toast glass upside down it's a secret signal and the servers will take it away. The champagne toast came, I raised my water glass - and guess what everybody was looking at the bride and groom, nobody cared about my glass and what it held. I did it immediately upon sitting down and notice Hello :) I have a client which uses CRM software and needs to share Datamax 4204B stickers printer between 2 computers. The problem is that the CRM software runs on 2012 standard server and there can only be one printer settings, So when the printer is configured as local usb on one computer and shared on the 2nd computer, It prints only on the 1st computer through the CRM software because it is set to print to the local USB port (With other stickers printing software like bartender 10 it print. 
At my local pub, we have a dice game in which you put  into a jar, and you get one roll with five six-sided dice. The goal is to exactly match the number on the side of the jar. If your five dice match the number, you win 80% of the pot. (10% for bartender, 10% re-seeds the jar) My question is, are there different probabilities of rolling different sets of numbers with a single roll? Is rolling 1-2-3-4-5 a different probability then 6-6-6-6-6? What are the probabilities? Note: The number. I read a post on /r/askseddit and I thought the answer is a general requirement. So here goes: I have a go-to bar/club and a stand-by bar. Both of these places I have visited on/off a few times. Here's how I worked them to make them my go-to. 1- Scoped out the bars which looked awesome in my area, went there a few times with friends at night to see how the place is on crowded nights. 2- Decided on 2 of them 3- Visited said bars in the day.
